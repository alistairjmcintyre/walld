# <p align="center">WallD
This is a tiny script that "still" uses qt to sit in your tray and change wallpapers, just for you
Main idea is to grub some fresh and good wallpapers based on your preferences, tags, likes, etc

This script is kind of pre alpha, and if you still wanna use it than
Please, use branch walld_api(its unavailable for now)

#TODO:
making client side more accurate
rewrite it to GTK3+
